# simple-ripple
Simple material ripple effect in native js + css

# Usage
Either download/close this repo or install it through bower with `bower install simple-ripple` and include this js and css on your page.
Give all the elements which could use a ripple a ripple class.
Optionally you can set a custom ripple color or opacity with the following data attributes:
`data-ripple-opacity='0.5'` and `data-ripple-color='#fff'`
Then simply call `initSimpleRipple()` to get it all started.
